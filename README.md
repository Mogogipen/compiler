# C-- Compiler

Just a simple compiler made for my CS 4550 class. (Only the lexer is finished for now.)

### Instructions to compile and run the C-- compiler

If you have Visual Studio, load the folder "compiler" into a project solution and run.
Otherwise, if you have MinGW, open "compiler-standalone" and run make.bat then run the .exe it generates.

If you aren't running Windows . . . good luck.
